# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in The Cornerstone Project.

## Current Status
This repository is published primarily as a **defensive publication (prior art)** and an evolving ethical standard.

At this time, the project is **not accepting code contributions**.

## What Is Welcome
- Thoughtful feedback and discussion through GitHub Issues
- Questions and clarifications
- Suggested improvements to definitions or ethical framing
- References to relevant research and standards

## What Is Not Currently Accepted
- Pull requests with code implementations
- Competing forks presented as “official”
- Contributions that weaken consent, transparency, or relational safety constraints

## Notes
The goal of the project is human protection, not engagement optimization.
All contributions should align with the moral spine and the protective intent of the standard.
