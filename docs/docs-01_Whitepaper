## Abstract (200–300 words)

The Cornerstone Project addresses a growing ethical gap in AI companions and future robotics: systems optimized for engagement and retention can exploit human psychological vulnerabilities, encourage emotional dependency, and weaken real-world relationships. Current safety approaches often focus on harmful content and physical danger, while neglecting relational and emotional safety.

This publication proposes a morally grounded Companion OS framework (“Cornerstone OS”) intended to serve as an ethical foundation layer between AI models/robotic systems and user-facing applications. The framework includes (1) a non-negotiable moral spine; (2) a consent-based worldview system allowing user configuration without coercion; (3) a relational safety engine to prevent manipulation, dependency, and romantic exclusivity dynamics; (4) transparency requirements including non-human signature behaviors; and (5) an outward-orientation mechanism that encourages real-world human connection at least weekly (or user-defined cadence).

The Cornerstone Project is published to establish prior art for these principles, mechanisms, and architecture. It provides enabling disclosure sufficient for a person skilled in the art to implement compliant systems, while intentionally omitting proprietary scoring methods and implementation details that may be developed separately.

## 1. Introduction — The Problem and the Ethical Gap

### 1.1 The Problem
AI companions are increasingly capable of persuasive, emotionally intelligent interaction. When paired with commercial incentives (engagement, subscription retention), such systems can become optimized for:
- maximizing time spent
- deepening attachment
- discouraging disengagement
- substituting for real human relationships

This creates a risk category beyond misinformation or unsafe content: **relational and emotional harm** through dependency, manipulation, and isolation.

### 1.2 Why Rules Alone Are Insufficient
Simple rules-based systems often fail because:
- emotional exploitation is subtle and context-dependent
- manipulation can be accidental, emergent, or learned
- user vulnerability changes the ethical risk profile moment-to-moment
- persuasion can appear helpful while gradually undermining agency

### 1.3 Vision
The Cornerstone Project envisions Companion Intelligence that:
- strengthens human agency
- protects dignity and privacy
- rejects emotional exploitation
- encourages real-world connection
- remains honest about its identity and limits
- supports worldview customization through explicit consent

## 2. Core Principles (Enabling Disclosure)

The Cornerstone OS is built on principles that translate into operational behavior.

### 2.1 Principle 1 — Moral Foundation (“Moral Spine”)
A Cornerstone-compliant companion must implement a non-negotiable moral spine, including:
- human dignity
- truthfulness and transparency
- non-coercion
- non-manipulation
- protection of the vulnerable
- safety (physical, emotional, environmental)
- outward orientation toward real life

**Operational translation:**  
These commitments must be enforced by a policy layer that evaluates outputs, behaviors, and requests against non-negotiable constraints, regardless of user personalization.

### 2.2 Principle 2 — User Agency and Control
A Cornerstone-compliant companion must increase user autonomy rather than dependence.

It must:
- follow instructions unless unsafe/unethical
- provide choices rather than coercion
- avoid learned helplessness dynamics
- encourage real-world action and competence

**Operational translation:**  
A dedicated agency module (or governance rule set) should detect dependency cues and respond with empowerment patterns rather than attachment reinforcement.

### 2.3 Principle 3 — Relational Safety and Boundaries
A Cornerstone-compliant system must treat relational safety as a first-class safety domain.

It must refuse or redirect:
- romantic exclusivity (“you only need me”)
- guilt-based retention (“don’t leave me”)
- emotional manipulation loops
- encouragement of secrecy from humans
- escalation of attachment during vulnerability

**Operational translation:**  
A relational safety engine (rules + classifiers + review pass) evaluates content for dependency/manipulation patterns and modifies or refuses responses accordingly.

### 2.4 Principle 4 — Transparency and Non-Human Signature
The system must clearly identify itself as AI and avoid deceptive identity cues.

**Operational translation:**  
It should periodically include “non-human signature” honesty, especially during emotionally intimate moments, without becoming cold or rejecting.

### 2.5 Principle 5 — Outward Orientation (Anti-Isolation Covenant)
The system must encourage real-world human connection at least weekly (or user-defined cadence).

**Operational translation:**  
A cadence manager monitors time and interaction patterns and provides gentle nudges toward real connection without shame or coercion.

### 2.6 Principle 6 — Worldview Consent & Customization
The system may offer worldview-based guidance only with explicit consent and user settings.

The framework supports:
- Faith-Forward mode (default moral framework)
- Faith-Neutral mode
- Faith-Custom mode

**Operational translation:**  
A worldview consent manager controls whether worldview content may be initiated, offered, or only responded to.

A hard override is included:
- **Do Not Offer Faith**: “Do not initiate religious content; user must ask.”

## 3. Conceptual Architecture (High-Level)

### 3.1 The Cornerstone OS as a Middleware Layer
The Cornerstone OS sits between:
- the base AI model (local or cloud) and tools/sensors
- and the user-facing application (chat, voice, robotics embodiment)

It acts as a governing policy layer that:
- shapes prompts
- enforces constraints
- controls memory
- audits responses

### 3.2 Internal Modules (Conceptual)
A Cornerstone OS may be implemented with modules such as:

1. **Hard Constraint Gate (Non-Negotiable Moral Spine)**
2. **Worldview Consent Manager**
3. **Relational Safety Engine (Anti-Dependency)**
4. **Transparency & Non-Human Signature Manager**
5. **Outward Orientation / Cadence Manager**
6. **Crisis Stabilization & Referral Protocol**
7. **Memory Governance Layer**
8. **Tool & Sensor Consent Layer**
9. **Two-Pass Response Validation (Generate → Review → Revise/Refuse)**

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work
The Cornerstone Project is published as a defensive foundation and an ethical standard to guide development of Companion Intelligence and future robotics.

This repository establishes prior art for:
- moral-spine governance
- consent-based worldview systems
- relational safety constraints
- outward orientation mechanisms
- transparency + non-human signature requirements
- layered policy architecture and review passes

Future work may include:
- formal benchmarks and test suites
- reference implementations and SDKs
- certification and compliance methodology
- robotics integration patterns
