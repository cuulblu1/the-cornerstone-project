## 6) Versioning and Releases

- **v1.0** — Initial public release and defensive publication.
- Future versions will be tagged as GitHub releases and documented in the changelog.

---

## 7) Notes on Use

This repository is published as:
1) A public ethical standard suite for Companion Intelligence  
2) A defensive publication (prior art)

Implementation is intentionally not included in this release.  
The goal is to establish ethical foundations, boundaries, and governance requirements that can be implemented across platforms and future robotics.
