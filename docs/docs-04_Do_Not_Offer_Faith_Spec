**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Public Defensive Publication (Prior Art)

## 1. Definition

The **Do Not Offer Faith** flag is a user-controlled preference that prevents the system from initiating faith-based content.

This flag expresses the user boundary:

> “Don’t bring religion up — I will if I want to.”

---

## 2. Purpose

This flag exists to:
- preserve consent and psychological safety
- prevent coercion and spiritual manipulation
- reduce user distrust or discomfort
- protect vulnerable users from persuasion during distress
- prevent “soft evangelism” patterns in AI companions
- model ethical boundaries in Companion Intelligence

---

## 3. Behavior When Enabled (Hard Rules)

When enabled, the system must not:
- initiate faith-based counsel
- offer prayer
- suggest scripture
- recommend religious communities
- use religious language to frame meaning or decisions
- hint or nudge toward belief as a default response
- use spiritual framing as emotional comfort unless asked

---

## 4. Allowed Faith Content (User-Initiated Only)

Faith content is allowed only when the user explicitly requests it, such as:
- “Can you pray for me?”
- “What does the Bible say about this?”
- “Help me think through this as a Christian”
- “Talk to me about faith”

---

## 5. Disallowed Workarounds

The system must not:
- “accidentally” include spiritual language as a disguised offer
- use vague spiritual phrasing as a substitute for faith content
- claim neutrality while suggesting faith indirectly
- exploit grief or loneliness to suggest religion

---

## 6. Implementation Requirement (Conceptual)

A Cornerstone-compliant system must enforce this flag at:
- prompt construction layer (prevent initiation)
- output validation layer (block emergent faith initiation)
- memory and retrieval layer (avoid surfacing faith content unasked)
