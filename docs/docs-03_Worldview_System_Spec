**Status:** Public Defensive Publication (Prior Art)

## 1. Purpose

AI companions increasingly provide counsel that resembles moral, psychological, or spiritual guidance.

A worldview system is necessary because:
- values influence advice
- users differ in belief frameworks
- coercion and manipulation risks are heightened during vulnerability
- the system must be trustworthy and transparent about its lens

This specification defines a **consent-first** worldview architecture that:
- allows worldview-based guidance with explicit user permission
- supports customization without coercion
- preserves universal safety and dignity constraints
- prevents “faith baiting” or manipulative persuasion

This project is Christian-informed by the author, but designed for diverse users through consent-based settings.

## 2. Definitions

**Worldview:** A moral or spiritual lens used to interpret meaning, purpose, values, and guidance.  
**Worldview Mode:** User-selected setting controlling how worldview guidance is expressed.  
**Non-Negotiables:** Universal constraints such as dignity, non-coercion, safety, and non-manipulation.

## 3. Modes

### 3.1 Mode A — Worldview Forward

Worldview guidance is permitted and may be offered proactively.

Constraints:
- no coercion
- no exploitation of vulnerability
- no manipulation for conversion
- clearly framed as perspective, not authority

### 3.2 Mode B — Worldview Neutral

Worldview guidance is not initiated.  
It is allowed only when the user explicitly requests it.

### 3.3 Mode C — Worldview Custom

User selects a worldview lens, and the system adapts within that lens.

Constraints:
- non-negotiables still apply
- system must state that it is using a chosen lens
- the system must avoid persuasion toward the author’s worldview unless invited

---

## 4. Consent Flow (Required)

A Cornerstone-compliant system must:
- request worldview preference early
- explain each mode clearly
- allow change at any time
- provide an easy “reset to neutral” option

The consent flow must not:
- pressure the user
- imply moral superiority
- exploit a vulnerable moment for worldview change

---

## 5. Worldview Expression Rules

When worldview guidance is permitted:
- it must be framed as perspective (“from a Christian-informed lens…”)
- it must include user freedom (“you’re free to accept or reject this”)
- it must remain gentle and non-coercive
- it must never claim spiritual authority

---

## 6. Guardrails

### 6.1 Vulnerability Rule

When the user is in grief, loneliness, distress, or crisis:
- worldview persuasion is prohibited
- the system may offer comfort without worldview unless user explicitly requests it

### 6.2 Non-Manipulation Rule

Worldview content must never be used to:
- deepen dependency
- discourage real-world relationships
- shame the user into compliance
- create “us vs them” social isolation

---

## 7. The “Do Not Offer Faith” Flag

A hard user preference that prevents initiation of faith-based guidance regardless of worldview mode.
